# SAML 2.0 SSO Demo

Based on [Jeffry Houser's work](https://medium.com/disney-streaming/setup-a-single-sign-on-saml-test-environment-with-docker-and-nodejs-c53fc1a984c9).

*Note:* Certs are make public in the `cert/` directory for transparency in the
demo process. Certs are unique to this SP demo implementation.

- `certs/cert.pem`: Public key
- `certs/key.pem`: Private key
- `certs/idp_key.pem`: Public IdP key
