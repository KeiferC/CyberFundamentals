# Week 1 - Basic Networking

## Why Networking and NetSec?
- The Trinity of Trouble - "Connectivity"
- Critical to understanding the cyber attribution problem


## The Cyber Attribution Problem
- __Attribution__: the action of regarding something as being cause by a person
  or a thing

### Tradtional Warfare - How Do you Attribute an Act of War?
- Uniform of attackers
- Types of weapons used by attackers
- Direction of strike
- etc.

### Why Is Cyber Attribution a Mess?
- Often no physical action to observe
- Tools to cover tracks
- Source hopping
- Lack of effective tools / processes for determining attribution
- Ethical and legal questions about approaching cyber attribution
