## Ways of Attacking Networks
- Sniffing
- Network reconnaissance
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Impersonation (spoofing)
- Hijacking (information access, delivery tampering)


## Network Sniffing - An Introduction
__Network sniffing__: looking at network traffic and analyzing packets
  - Most traffic on a network is still in plaintext
  - Uses of network sniffing
    - Troubleshoot networking issues
    - Record communications
    - Catch sensitive information

__.pcap__: a common file extension for packet captures
  - Is commonly used in apps like Wireshark, ettercap, and tcpdump
  - A 100 mb PCAP file contains tens of thousands of packets
