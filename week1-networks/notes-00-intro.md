## Definitions
__Cyber Security__: The CIA Triad
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

__Event__: Could be anything

__Incident__: A malicious event

__Bug__: An error that exists in the implementation-level
- Only exists in source code
- Very correctable

__Flaw__: An error at a level deeper than implementation
- Likely exists at the code level
- Likely to be result of a design error
- Can be difficult and costly to correct

__Hacker__: A creative programmer (positive connotation)

__Attacker__: What the media calls a "hacker" (negative connotation)
- AKA Cracker

__Black hat__: An attacker with malicious intents

__White hat__: An attacker with good intents

__Gray hat__: An attacker with good and bad intents

__Script kiddie__: Hacker wannabes who use scripts and exploits written by others without understanding how they work
- AKA skiddie

__Vulnerability__: A security bug; a weakness that can be exploited

__Exploiting__: The act of taking advantage of a vulnerability

__Risk__: The likelihood that an attacker would exploit a vulnerability

__Threat__: The likelihood that an incident will happen

__pwn3d__: Successful exploitation

__Zero day__: An undisclosed vulnerability that attackers can exploit


## Thinking Like An Attacker - What Are Your Goals?
- Preventing communications
- Stealing information
- Disrupting operations
- Inserting information
- Destroying information
- Gaining and maintaining access to systems
- Monitoring people
- Challening adversaries / pinpointing weaknesses
- For fun
- For profit
- Spread propaganda
- Building a blueprint of weaknesses


## Thinking Like An Attacker - Why Attack? 
- Implicit trust relationships
- Data is valuable
- Convenience of digitalization
- Convenience from internet usage and from data sharing
- Lack of cyber education
- No barriers to entry
- Lack of deterrence
- Software vulnerabilities
- Misconfigurations
- Human elements / social engineering
- Scapegoating


## The Trinity of Trouble - Why Are Cyber Threats Increasing?
1. Increasing Connectivity
2. Increasing Extensibility
3. Increasing Complexity
