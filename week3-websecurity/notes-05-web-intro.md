## What Is the Web

Servers containing resources (e.g. images, text, websites, memes, etc.) and 
the means of processing and delivering said resources.

### Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)

Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are a subset of Uniform Resource Identifiers 
(URIs) that tell clients how to access a resource. Because the RFCs suck, there 
is often much confusion over what defines a URL vs what defines a URI. At 
the end of the day, a URI is an identifier (the name of a resource), whereas 
a URL is a locator (how to get the resource). In other words, URIs standardize 
the names of files on web servers. URLs standardize the means of obtaining 
files on a web server. URLs use the following generic URI syntax.

## The Hypertext Tranfer Protocol (HTTP)

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a layer 7 (application) protocol that 
specifies how data is communicated through the Web. Note: HTTPS is HTTP on 
a TLS / SSL session.

HTTP consists of two main processes: request and response.

the client, the server, and the database.
