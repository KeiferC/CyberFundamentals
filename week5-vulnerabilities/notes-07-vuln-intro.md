## The Vulnerability Disclosure Problem
In cybersecurity, we find vulnerabilities so that developers can patch
the weaknesses before they get exploited (or exploited more). At the 
end of the day, the goal is to protect the rights of users. However, 
there are those who have different perspectives regarding vulnerabilities, 
including:

- Attackers who wish to exploit the vulnerabilities for personal gain.
- Whistleblowers who wish to exploit the vulnerabilities to disclose
  protected information.
- Law enforcement agencies who wish to exploit the vulnerabilities for 
  investigative purposes.
- Governments who wish to exploit the vulnerabilities for "national 
  security" reasons.
- Companies who keep the vulnerabilities secret for profit reasons (e.g.
  stock prices, customer retainment, cost of patches, exploitation).
- Organization who wish to exploit the vulnerabilities to further political
  and / or personal interests.
- Apathetic parties who are not well-informed about or are not concerened
  about cybersecurity.

Therefore, there are several conundrums that a hacker must face when 
attempting to disclose vulnerabilities:

- Will the vulnerability be patched?
- What are the consequences if the vulnerabilities do not get patched?
- What are the consequences of disclosing vulnerabilties to others?
- What to do if the owner of the product containing the vulnerability 
  has no intention of patching the problem?
- What legal issues may arise from disclosing the vulnerability?
- What pushback may occur from the vulnerability disclosure?
- Should the disclosure be disclosed if it is not likely to be patched?
- What consequences will I face if I disclose this vulnerability?
- and more...

If you are having concerns regarding vulnerability disclosures, you may want 
to check out [HackerOne's Vulnerability Disclosure Guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines).

### The Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP)
The Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP) is a process used by the 
United States government in order to decide whether to disclose a zero-day 
vulnerability to the concerned parties or to keep the vulnerability a secret 
to advance government interests. In short, the VEP brings specific government
agencies, known as the Equities Review Board (ERB), together in order to 
balance each agency's interests regarding the found vulnerability.

The ERB consists of:
- The National Security Agency (NSA), who serves as the executive secretariat
- Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
- Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)
- United States Department of the Treasury (DT)
- United States Department of State (DOS)
- United States Department of Justice (DOJ) 
- Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
- United States Department of Energy (DOE)
- United States Department of Defense (DOD) 
- United States Department of Commerce (DOC) 
- Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

The ERB meets monthly.
